ACT I
    A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
    Against the which, a moiety competent
    A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
    A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
    A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
    And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
    And carriage of the article design'd,
    And even the like precurse of fierce events,
    And foreign mart for implements of war;
    And I am sick at heart.
    And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
    And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
    And let us once again assail your ears,
    And liegemen to the Dane.
    And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
    And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
    And our vain blows malicious mockery.
    And prologue to the omen coming on,
    And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
    And then it started like a guilty thing
    And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;
    And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
    And we beseech you, bend you to remain
    And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
    And will not let belief take hold of him
    And with no less nobility of love
    An understanding simple and unschool'd:
    a piece of him.
    As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
    As harbingers preceding still the fates
    [Aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind.
    As it doth well appear unto our state--
    As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
    As of a father: for let the world take note,
    As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
    As thou art to thyself:
    At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
    Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
    Ay, madam, it is common.
    Before my God, I might not this believe

    But to recover of us, by strong hand
    But, you must know, your father lost a father;

    Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,

    Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:

    If it be,

    If thou art privy to thy country's fate,

    If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,

    In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--
    In filial obligation for some term

    In obstinate condolement is a course
    In that and all things will we show our duty.
    In the most high and palmy state of Rome,

    In what particular thought to work I know not;
    In which the majesty of buried Denmark
    Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
    Is it not like the king?

    I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?
    I think it be no other but e'en so:

    Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.

    No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
    Nor customary suits of solemn black,
    Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
    Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,
    Not a mouse stirring.
    Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.
    Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
    Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
    O, farewell, honest soldier:
    Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
    Of mine own eyes.
    Of these delated articles allow.
    Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress
    Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
    Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
    Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
    Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
    Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
    Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
    Out of his subject: and we here dispatch
    Passing through nature to eternity.
    Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!
QUEEN GERTRUDE
QUEEN GERTRUDE
    Question it, Horatio.
    Re-enter Ghost
    Say,
SCENE I. Elsinore. A platform before the castle.
SCENE II. A room of state in the castle.
    See, it stalks away!
    Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
    Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'
    Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
    Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
    Sit down awhile;
    So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
    So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,
    So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
    So have I heard and do in part believe it.
    Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
    So nightly toils the subject of the land,
    Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.
    Speak to me:
    Speak to me:
    Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!
    Such was the very armour he had on
    Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
    Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd
    Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
    Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
    Than that which dearest father bears his son,
    That are so fortified against our story
    That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,
    That can I;
    That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
    That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--
    That if again this apparition come,
    That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
    That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
    That was and is the question of these wars.
    That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
    The bell then beating one,--
    The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
    The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
    The extravagant and erring spirit hies
    The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
    The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
    The head is not more native to the heart,
    The imperial jointress to this warlike state,
    The lists and full proportions, are all made
    The memory be green, and that it us befitted
    The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
    Therefore I have entreated him along
    Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
    Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
    The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
    These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
    The source of this our watch and the chief head
    This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
    'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth
    This present object made probation.
    This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
    This unprevailing woe, and think of us
    Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
    Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
    Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,
    Thus much the business is: we have here writ
    Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
    'Tis gone!
    'Tis gone, and will not answer.
    'Tis here!
    'Tis here!
    'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
    'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.
    'Tis strange.
    'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
    To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
    To be contracted in one brow of woe,
    To business with the king, more than the scope
    To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever
    Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
    Together with remembrance of ourselves.
    Together with that fair and warlike form
    To give these mourning duties to your father:
    To his confine: and of the truth herein
    To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--
    To offer it the show of violence;
    To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
    To reason most absurd: whose common theme
    To show my duty in your coronation,
    To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
    Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
    Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
    Unto our climatures and countrymen.--
    Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
    Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,
    Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
    Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
    Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
    Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
    Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
    Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
    We do it wrong, being so majestical,
    We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.
    Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.
    Well, good night.
    Well may it sort that this portentous figure
    Well ratified by law and heraldry,
    Well, sit we down,
    What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
    What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
    What, is Horatio there?
    What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
    What think you on't?
    What we have two nights seen.
    What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
    When he the ambitious Norway combated;
    When yond same star that's westward from the pole
    Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
    Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
    Where we shall find him most conveniently.
    Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
    Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!
    Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:
    Who hath relieved you?
    Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
    Who is't that can inform me?
    Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
    Who's there?
    Why seems it so particular with thee?
    Why should we in our peevish opposition
    Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
    Why this same strict and most observant watch
    With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
    With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
    With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
    Without the sensible and true avouch
    With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
    With us to watch the minutes of this night;
    Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
    Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
    You are the most immediate to our throne;
    You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
    You come most carefully upon your hour.
    You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
    Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
    Your leave and favour to return to France;
    You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?

    But, you must know, your father lost a father;
    To give these mourning duties to your father:
    Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
    'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
    That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--
    O, farewell, honest soldier:
    To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever
    Giving to you no further personal power
    'Tis gone, and will not answer.
    Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
    Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:
    Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
    You come most carefully upon your hour.
    To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
    To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--
    His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
    Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
    Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
    And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
    Importing the surrender of those lands
    Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
    Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
    The extravagant and erring spirit hies
    His further gait herein; in that the levies,
    Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
    As harbingers preceding still the fates
LAERTES
    What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
    And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
    You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?
    Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
    Together with remembrance of ourselves.
    Of mine own eyes.
    And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
    With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
    Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'
    Is the main motive of our preparations,
    Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
    And let us once again assail your ears,
    That was and is the question of these wars.
    Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress
    Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
    Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, HAMLET, POLONIUS, LAERTES, VOLTIMAND, CORNELIUS, Lords, and Attendants
    And even the like precurse of fierce events,
    This unprevailing woe, and think of us
    Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:

    If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
    Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.
    Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.
    Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
    Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
    Cock crows
    Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
    Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,
HAMLET

HAMLET
HAMLET
    'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
    Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--
    Well, good night.
    Give you good night.
    Give you good night.
    What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
    Let us impart what we have seen to-night
    What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
    With us to watch the minutes of this night;
    So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
    So have I heard and do in part believe it.
    Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
    He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
    Thus much the business is: we have here writ
    Exit
    Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,
    A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
    Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
    Against the which, a moiety competent
    Do I impart toward you. For your intent
    What think you on't?
    Exeunt
    In what particular thought to work I know not;
    The head is not more native to the heart,
    And I am sick at heart.
    By laboursome petition, and at last
    Enter Ghost
    Re-enter Ghost
    Exit Ghost
    Exit Ghost
    Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
    Who hath relieved you?
    And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
    How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
    Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
    It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
    But I have that within which passeth show;
    Of these delated articles allow.
    Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
    Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
    From the first corse till he that died to-day,
    For they are actions that a man might play:
    Say,
    See, it stalks away!
    For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;
    Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
    Where we shall find him most conveniently.
    Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--
    Well ratified by law and heraldry,
    And our vain blows malicious mockery.
    That are so fortified against our story
    Is not this something more than fantasy?
    Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
    Passing through nature to eternity.
    As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
    In that and all things will we show our duty.
    Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
